- âš¡ Fun fact: The Eastern Screech Owl flies fairly rapidly with a steady wingbeat (about 5 strokes/second). They rarely glide but may fly with erratic movements when maneuvering through wooded areas.
   Their wings are broad and the head is held tucked in, giving the bird a stubby appearance when flying.
